# Collaborative Coding Challenge: My Two Lines

Dear Future Coders,

As we stand on the threshold of venturing into the real world, armed with knowledge and skills honed over our time here, let’s take a moment to come together one last time, not as individuals, but as a single entity, a beacon of collaborative spirit and creativity. Today, we weave together lines of code to craft a collaborative masterpiece. 

## The Setup

We start with a base structure, a skeletal framework to nurture our collective creativity:

```Go
package main

import "github.com/01-edu/z01"

func main() {
    // hidestream
    ███████████████████
    z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

The `// hidestream` comment in our setup serves as a curtain, revealing only a portion of the code narrative to guide your contributions.

## Instructions

- **Your Moment**: Step forward to have your moment with the evolving code narrative when your turn arrives.
- **Interpret and Imagine**: Engage with the last visible line of code and imagine the possibilities. Try to run the code with `go run .` to understand the current state of the code.
- **Craft Your Contribution**: Craft your two lines of code, extending the narrative logically and creatively. Remember, your contribution should not break the working of the code; it should still run successfully at the end of your turn.
- **Maintain Code Structure**: If you initiate a code structure such as an `if` clause, ensure to close it properly within your turn. (The closing brackets should remain visible to maintain the structural integrity of the code.)
- **Error Check**: Ensure there are no syntax errors in your contribution. Execute the code with `go run .` before you proceed to the next step. 
- **Move the Marker**: Once you have ensured the code runs successfully, add the `// hidestream` comment marker to the last line that was visible to you when you started, and also the first line you wrote - leaving your second line and the structural closing elements (like closing brackets) visible to the next contributor.
- **Pass the Baton**: Allow the next coder to the keyboard, inviting them to add to our collective creation.

## Points to Remember

- **Creativity**: Allow your creativity to flourish, adding unique and inventive lines to our collaborative code artwork.
- **Harmony**: Work in harmony with the visible cues, maintaining a thread of coherence and functionality.
- **Celebration**: Celebrate the spirit of collective creation, adding your note to our coding symphony.

## Conclusion

As we bring this tapestry of code to life, let's cherish this collaborative spirit with creating a living testament to our journey.
